The repository contains code to interpret part of the eRNA Expression Module
of the Human enhancer RNA Atlas (HeRA) available at (https://hanlab.tamhsc.edu/HeRA/) 
Our team wrote the code ourselves in the Jupyter notebook to create a figure 
of ENSR00000205340 eRNA expression level across several different human tissues.
