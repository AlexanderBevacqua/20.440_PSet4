At a high level, what does your repo contain / do? 
Include citations for any scripts your team did not write that are 
included directly in the repo and any non-standard methods that your

The repository contains code to interpret part of the eRNA Expression Module
of the Human enhancer RNA Atlas (HeRA) available at (https://hanlab.tamhsc.edu/HeRA/) 
Our team wrote the code ourselves in the Jupyter notebook to create a figure 
of ENSR00000205340 eRNA expression level across several different human tissues.
