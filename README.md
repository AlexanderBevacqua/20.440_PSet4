<h2>Overview</h2>

At a high level, what does your repo contain / do? 
Include citations for any scripts your team did not write that are 
included directly in the repo and any non-standard methods that your 
analysis is based on. 

The repository contains code to interpret part of the eRNA Expression Module
of the Human enhancer RNA Atlas (HeRA) available at (https://hanlab.tamhsc.edu/HeRA/) 
Our team wrote the code ourselves in the Jupyter notebook to create a figure 
of ENSR00000205340 eRNA expression level across several different human tissues.

<h2>Data</h2>

At a high level, how was the data generated? 
If it’s too large to upload to your GitHub, where can it be accessed?
Include citations, if any.

The data, acquired from the HeRA, is located in this repository and is 
available at (https://hanlab.tamhsc.edu/HeRA/m1). The eRNA Expression Module
offers raw data csv files on specific eRNA to analyze their transcriptomic 
differences across different tissue types.

<h2>Folder structure </h2>

At a high level, what is in each folder and subfolder?

The Jupyter notebook is located at https://github.com/AlexanderBevacqua/20.440_PSet4 and the
Data and Figures are located in separate folders with those respective names. You can run 
the code in the Jupyter notebook and the figure will be saved into the Figures folder, as
well as displayed within the notebook itself.

<h2>Installation </h2>

How do I run your code?

Please download the ZIP file of the repository, unzip it, and open the Jupyter notebook
using your preferred method (I use Anaconda Navigator).
